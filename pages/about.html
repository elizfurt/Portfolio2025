      <p>I'm a developer and IT professional with a strong background in JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Electron. Over the years, I’ve built internal tools, automated workflows, and customized Laserfiche forms, all aimed at making processes more efficient and user-friendly.
<br><br>
I enjoy tackling problems head-on, whether that’s designing secure authentication systems, optimizing databases, or creating seamless web applications. I’m always looking for ways to improve how technology can support better business operations and smoother user experiences.
<br><br>
I’m passionate about learning new things and pushing the boundaries of what technology can do, always ready for the next challenge.</p>

    <div class="about bck-block2">
    <div class="info-from">
      <p> Originally from Somerset, MA, I moved to Providence about 5 years ago. Prior to moving back to the Southcoast area, I attended Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi (Go Rebs!). At Ole Miss, I studied English and Liberal Studies. Though an unconventional start to a career in software development, my liberal arts backgroundmakes me a well-rounded individual with strong communications skills. These communication skills have proven invaluable as I work with users and clients to create the systems they need.
<br><br>
Right now, my favorite way to spend a Saturday is either trying out a new RPG Game on Steam, playing Dungeons and Dragons, or spending time with family and friends. In addition to software development, I have a strong interest in game development, and you can often find me working on a game in Godot.
